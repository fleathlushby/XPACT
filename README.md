# XPACT
 A Comprehensive X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) Dataset for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Assurance and Counterfeit Tracking

 This repository includes the codebase of our recently published work "X-Factor: Deep Learning-based PCB Counterfeit Detection using X-ray CT Techniques for Hardware Assurance"

 The codebase corresponds to five different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models which are transfer-learned on ImageNet dataset and fine tuned for the specific X-ray CT dataset. 

 This repository also includes the link to the X-ray CT dataset of 9 different classes of PCBs, uploaded in a private repository of Hugging Face, named as XPACT.
